<h2>Her favorite Poem </h2>
I wish I was courageous<br>
I wish I trusted myself more <br>
I want to see the world<br>
I want to take my family to vacations<br>
I want to be happy and at peace<br>
And away from this toxic enviroment<br>
But it's going to take a lot of commitment<br>
And sleepless nights..<br>
I can do this<br>
