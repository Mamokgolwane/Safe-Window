<p><h3 align="center"><u>Short Summary about myself</u></h3>
    My name&apos;s <b>Mamokgolwane Moloi</b> and I am 23 years old. I am an Aries Sun, a Sagittarius Moon &amp; Rising.
     I finished Grade 12 in 2017 and I have since enrolled at the <strong>University of the Western Cape</strong> for an LLB
      then dropped out after a year. I enrolled again at the <strong>North-West University - Vaal Triangle Campus</strong> for a FA degree. I am now in my 
      4th year of this degree and its been one of the most painful things I've ever done in my life because I have struggled to find a career path that I was really passionate about.
      As I sit and write this, I have found it. Finally. I am working towards being a <em>Software Developer</em> and I won't lie, I feel really excited and finally ready.</p>

<p2>
      Please don't judge me. I also feel like I've wasted time, but I know that this time all these previous years I had never felt or knew this was a possible career path for me.
      I have always felt behind and so lost because I felt like I was the only one who wasn't following their heart or passion. Ever since finishing high school I have been very lonely. I still am. Mostly because I struggle making friendships.
      They are so demanding and most of the time I just want to be alone and not talk to anyone. The ones that I still have from high school are of people currently in Capetown, and we see each other once a year.
      Trust me, I would love to make friendships this side, but I just feel like I am not ready. I am of the opinion that a <i>Peppermint Crisp Tart is &gt; a Apple Crumble Pie</i>.I also just recently went through a breakup with someone I had been with since 2019. I really value my solitude at the moment,
       and I believe that I will make freindships when I am ready. Please cross your fingers and pray for my success. &hearts;
