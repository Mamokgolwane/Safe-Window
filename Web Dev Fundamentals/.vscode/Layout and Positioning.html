    <h4>How are we feeling today?</h4>
    <p>Hi everyone my name is Mamo and this is my daily blog. I write about all this sad and happy :).
        I am currently studying to become a Software Developer and I am so excited. I have been searching 
        for something that I would probably enjoy doing as a career for almost 5 years now and I can't be
         more excited or terrifid enough. I am really grateful to have been able to reach this thing in time.
          I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would feel the way I do right now. I have learnt to
           surrender the control that I think I have over my life because I realize everyday that I do not have any.
        I have tried to hold on to the idea of what this control is and to things in my life, but I have only been met by disappointment and pain everytime.
        The truth is, I know nothing. I know nothing at all. I know nothing about where I am going and that scares me so much, because I don't know if that place
        is what I have in mind. The only thing I have right now is hope and optimism. I don't want to suffer more than i already have in the past.
        I don't want to experience the pain and the tears that I have experienced before. I am ready for my dream life. I know that the Universe has got me. I am 
        still human though and I will have doubt every now and then, and be worried every now and then, but I know I am protected. I always have been. Even that little child I was.
